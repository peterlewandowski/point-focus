## ❓ FAQ

### How do I apply zoom to a specific image or gallery?

You can apply zoom by simply using the `<ImageMagnifier />` component and passing the desired image source as the `src` prop. For advanced integration, you can target specific images or galleries by wrapping them in the component or by using CSS selectors if you extend the functionality[5].

### Can I use this with page builders or in custom layouts?

Yes, you can use `point-focus` in any React-based layout, including custom grids, galleries, or even with page builder frameworks. Just import and use the component where needed in your JSX[5].

### Is it possible to use a zoom lens or magnifier glass effect?

Currently, `point-focus` supports full-image zoom with drag and inertia. A movable lens or magnifier glass effect is planned for future releases (see Roadmap)[1].

### Does it support touch and mobile devices?

Yes, touch and mobile support is implemented, including drag and tap-to-zoom features. Pinch-to-zoom is planned for a future update.

### How do I customize the zoom behavior?

You can control activation (click or hover), zoom scale, animation duration, and more via component props. See the Usage section for examples.

### What happens if the zoom image fails to load?

At the moment, there is no custom error handling or fallback UI. This feature is planned for a future release.

### Can I use this in a modal or overlay?

Yes, the component can be rendered inside a modal or overlay. Dedicated modal integration and lightbox support are planned for future versions.

### Is programmatic control available?

Not yet. Programmatic zoom in/out methods are on the roadmap.
